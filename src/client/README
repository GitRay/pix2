quickypix/src/client/skin: static files that the client should download
                           directly.

    To have QuickyPix serve these files, specify the path using SKIN_PATH in
    config.py.

    You can also Alias this directory in your Apache config file (more
    efficient delivery).

quickypix/src/client/templates: template files that are only needed by
                                QuickyPix; no need for Apache to see them.
