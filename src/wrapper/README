quickypix.cgi.su is a small C program that is intended to be setuid/setgid.
All it does is run quickypix.cgi.  However, it first checks authorizes only
www-data to run it and cleans the environment.

It is based on the suexec program from apache 2.0.54.

To use:

- set the Makefile variables (required)
- run `make'
- substitute quickypix.cgi.su for quickypix.cgi
