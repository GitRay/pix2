QuickyPix
=========

v1.1 2005-09-26

QuickyPix is an instant thumbnail photo gallery system in Python.

Why another one?  It's the same old story - I wanted a photo gallery exactly
the way I wanted it.  The best one I found was "Pix" by Demian Neidetcher
<http://pix.sf.net>, so I wrote one based on Pix, with the exact set of
features I wanted.  I owe Demian Neidetcher a lot for a great do-it-yourself
framework.

Demo: http://photo.quarl.org/

Features
--------

* Thumbnails
    * Album highlight with outset border.
    * Movie thumbnails, with distinctive "movie" label.

* "Instant-on"
    * No import needed
    * Cached on-demand image resizing

* Meaningful URLs
    * Web hierarchy reflects file system hierarchy
    * Add pictures simply by copying to the photo directory

* The photo tree is untouched (except when editing metadata)
    * Cache data goes in a separate tree /var/cache/pix.
    * Thus, you can easily backup the entire photo tree

* Supported formats: jpg, png, gif, etc.; avi, mpg

* Picture info
    * Image dimensions, picture-taken timestamp, movie length, codec, etc.

* Metadata: album title, album comment, picture comment, album highlight

* Admin mode
    * Resizing, deleting, editing captions, changing highlight

* Template engine using XHTML and CSS
    * Fluid-yet-aligned thumbnail arrangement (no tables)
    * Validated XHTML 1.0 Strict, CSS

Usage
-----

Example setup with apache:

    <Directory /home/quarl/proj/quickypix>
        Options ExecCGI
        Order allow,deny
        Allow from all
    </Directory>

    ScriptAlias / /home/quarl/proj/quickypix/src/quickypix/quickypix.py/


ADMIN MODE: only adds a link to edit mode.

  - Authentication: none.
  - To enter admin mode: append ?admin=1 to URL.  This will set a cookie.

EDIT MODE: allows editing album comment, album name, pic comment; rename pic;
delete pic (with tdel).

  - Authentication: apache. I.e., authenticated if REMOTE_USER is set.
        - You can set up whatever authentication and/or encryption (e.g. SSL)
          you want


Metadata files:
    album/.title      - album title
    album/.comment    - album comment
    album/.highlight  - highlighted picture (for album icon)
    album/pic.comment - pic comment

Dependencies:
- ImageMagick (convert, identify) for getting image information, resizing
  images, rotating images, adding "movie" label
- MPlayer (mencoder) for rotating movies, making thumbnails
- Transcode (tcprobe) for getting movie information
