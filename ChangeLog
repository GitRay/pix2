2006-09-21  Karl Chen  <quarl@quarl.org>
    * Release v1.4.1
    * Hosted at Cubewano.org

2006-01-20  Karl Chen  <quarl@quarl.org>
    * Added support for EXIF ImageDescription (enable with DISPLAY_INFO)

    * New template/stylesheet/etc structure: quickypix/src/client is a
      directory containing templates/ and skin/.  Skin/ contains files
      served statically to the client and may be Aliased through Apache
      for efficiency.  Factored the various stylesheets; quickypix.css
      contains the common definitions.  Begin working on a new style that
      fixes image position.

    * Use first Pic as default highlight instead of first item (Pic or
      Album); reported by Grant Brown

    * Fixed crash when highlight pointed to an empty album; reported by
      Grant Brown

    * Don't write default values for .title, .highlight to disk (added
      "default" feature to MetadataProperty); reported by Grant Brown

    * Add configuration option for whether/how to sort root and non-root
      albums (reported by Grant Brown)

2006-01-19  Karl Chen  <quarl@quarl.org>
    * Removed '&' from banned filename characters, issue reported by Grant
      Brown

2005-12-16  Karl Chen  <quarl@quarl.org>
    * Created quickypix.cgi.su, a setuid wrapper (written in C, based on
      Apache 2.0.54's suexec).
    * New recommended permissions setup (install.html)
    * Added configuration option ALWAYS_USE_PUBLIC_FOR_PHOTOS: in admin
      mode, all jpgs are linked to the public root.  Advantages:
        - Client only needs to download pictures once if you move between
          roots
        - If the edit root and public root (s)cgi processes are under
          different userids, permissions for the cache directory are
          easier to manage if only one userid writes to it.
    * Factored quickypix.py to Presenter.py and quickypix.cgi
    * Move conversion scripts to new directory src/import/

2005-12-15  Karl Chen  <quarl@quarl.org>
    * Release v1.3.0

2005-12-14  Karl Chen  <quarl@quarl.org>
    * Added convert_gallery_dat (which was written 2005-01-12 and
      previously in the 'quarl' repository)

2005-12-07  Karl Chen  <quarl@quarl.org>
    * Make path configuration more robust

    * By default auto-detect the src/helpers/bin directory instead of
      requiring configuring it manually

    * Support older versions of ImageMagick that don't have '-thumbnail'
      option, via configuration parameter USE_IMAGEMAGICK_THUMBNAIL_OPTION

2005-12-06  Karl Chen  <quarl@quarl.org>
    * Fixed bug with caching thumbnails at root of image repository.  Bug
      reported by Grant Brown <grant@marstechnologies.com>.

2005-12-05  Karl Chen  <quarl@quarl.org>
    * Add tdel, movie2jpg, movie-rotate helpers to QuickyPix repository
      under quickypix/src/helpers/bin [originally at
      http://svn.quarl.org/repos/quarl/trunk/bin]
    * Add configuration options to set the location of various helper
      programs (the newly distributed ones as well as ImageMagick,
      Mplayer, Transcode). 
      
2005-12-05  Karl Chen  <quarl@quarl.org>
    * By default prefer ImageMagick to PIL (set USE_PIL=True to change).
    * PIL support: enable anti-aliasing and set JPEG quality 90.  TODO:
      adaptively set the JPEG quality based on input quality, the way
      ImageMagick does.
    * Fixed bug where comments were read and saved from 'name.comment'
      instead of 'name.jpg.comment'.  (Not really a bug, but inconsistent
      with the documentation; 'name.comment' behavior was accidentally
      introduced with the drop of extensions in URLs.)  Bug reported by
      Grant Brown <grant@marstechnologies.com>.

2005-12-04  Karl Chen  <quarl@quarl.org>
    * Added convert_descript_ion script for converting from 4DOS/ACDSee
      descript.ion files

2005-10-15  Karl Chen  <quarl@quarl.org>

2005-10-15  Karl Chen  <quarl@quarl.org>
    * Changed URL for fullsize pics to IMAGE.jpg instead of
      IMAGE/fullsize (resized pics are still IMAGE/123x456)

2005-10-15  Karl Chen  <quarl@quarl.org>
    * src/quickypix/util.py (MetadataProperty.set): Fixed 'recent' bug
      due to 2005-09-26 change
    * Other minor bug fixes

2005-10-14  Karl Chen  <quarl@quarl.org>
    * init.d/quickypix-scgi: startup script

2005-10-13  Hollis Blanchard  <hollis@penguinppc.org>
    * New SCGI handler.

2005-10-12  Karl Chen  <quarl@quarl.org>

2005-10-02  Hollis Blanchard  <hollis@penguinppc.org>
    * Disable warnings for default .title and .hightlight.
    * Use PIL when available -- it avoids the overhead of forking
      to use ImageMagick's `identify' and `convert'.

2005-09-27  Karl Chen  <quarl@quarl.org>
    * Release version 1.1

2005-09-27  Karl Chen  <quarl@quarl.org>
    * Directory structure reorg

2005-09-26  Hollis Blanchard  <hollis@penguinppc.org>
    * Ensure that the default settings (title, highlight) are used, even
      if the filesystem isn't writable.

2005-09-18  Karl Chen  <quarl@quarl.org>
    * Remove extensions from URLs.  Canonicalize extensionless URLs.
      Photos must be unambiguous without extension.

    * I used to prefer keeping the extension, but I want search engines
      to index these pages, and they blindly assume that an image link
      pointing to a .jpg URL is another image.

2005-06-09  Karl Chen  <quarl@quarl.org>
    * Use 'fullsize' instead of 'original'

2005-02-21  Karl Chen  <quarl@quarl.org>
    * Renamed pix -> quickypix

    * Use exif.py, imagemagick, instead of PIL

2005-02-06  Karl Chen  <quarl@quarl.org>
    * style.css: Add explicit album thumbnail height/width
      in case of weird-aspect photos.

    * Album.py: fixed bug with missing highlight

2005-01-15  Karl Chen  <quarl@quarl.org>
    * Restructuring/refactoring; moved stuff to image_util.py
    * Support MPEGs

    * Movie rotation, resizing, labeling - everything working!

2005-01-15  Karl Chen  <quarl@quarl.org>
    * Get movie info

    * Video rotating; use mplayer for video->image conversion also.

    * Implemented rotation

    * Implemented deletion

    * Edit mode, quick edit buttons, better caching.

2005-01-13  Karl Chen  <quarl@quarl.org>
    * template: Get rid of tables; use floating div for
      @pic@. Now we can put it before the nav pics so that the browser
      loads it first.

2005-01-12  Karl Chen  <quarl@quarl.org>
    * Major rewrite.

2005-01-13  Karl Chen  <quarl@quarl.org>
    * Initial import from pix.sf.net
