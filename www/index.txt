Yet ANOTHER photo gallery system?
---------------------------------

I've used a bunch of photo galleries and before QuickyPix was using Gallery_
(which I recommend if you just want a kitchen sink).  I researched looking for
something that fit my needs exactly but found none.  Demian Neidetcher
correctly noted that everyone wants to customize their photo gallery, so he
created Pix_, a simple gallery system that is easily customizable.  Pix is a
great base for writing the gallery system of your dreams.  So I forked it and
created my own.  Eventually I added enough features that I wanted to call it
something other than "Pix with quarl's additions", but I still wanted to
credit Pix.  If you want to create your own custom one you might start with
QuickyPix, or start with Pix and cherry-pick some features from QuickyPix.
