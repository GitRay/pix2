.. _QuickyPix: http://www.cubewano.org/quickypix/

QuickyPix is a photo gallery system.  See `history of development`_.

QuickyPix is not for everyone.  If you don't know anything about web and CGI
applications yet want a kitchen sink of features in your web gallery, I
recommend Gallery_.  If you want a very small base for developing your own
gallery software you might try Pix_, on which QuickyPix was originally based.

Thumbnails
  - Album highlight with outset border
  - Movie thumbnails, with distinctive "movie" label

"Instant-on"
  - No import needed: add pictures simply by copying to the photo directory
  - Cached, on-demand image resizing

Meaningful URLs
  - Web hierarchy reflects file system hierarchy

The photo tree is untouched (except when editing metadata)
  - Cache data goes in a separate tree
  - Thus, you can easily backup the entire photo tree

Picture info
  - Image dimensions, picture-taken timestamp, movie length, codec, etc.

Metadata
  - album title, album comment, picture comment, album highlight

Admin mode
  - Resizing, rotating (including movies), transcoding, deleting, editing
    captions, changing highlight
  - Security: can partition read-only normal mode into separate user id; only
    authenticated users can even run under process that has file system write
    permissions

Template engine using XHTML and CSS
