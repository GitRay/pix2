QuickyPix: History
==================

Yet ANOTHER photo gallery system?
---------------------------------

I've tried various photo gallery software and was dissatisfied with all of
them.  There are a *lot* of these around; apparently everyone wants different
features and a different "look".  Finally I bit the bullet and developed my
own.  Demian Neidetcher had created Pix_, a simple gallery system that is
easily customizable.  I forked development to add the features I wanted.
Eventually it had changed enough that I decided to call it something other
than "Pix with quarl's additions", while still crediting Pix.
