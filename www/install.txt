QuickyPix: Installation
=======================

QuickyPix has three modes:

- REGULAR mode is what users see.

- ADMIN mode is what users see, plus a "EDIT" link to EDIT mode.

  - Authentication: none.  It's just a convenience.

  - To enter admin mode: append ?admin=1 to URL.  This will set a permanent cookie.

- EDIT mode allows editing: album comment, album name, pic comment; rename pic;
  delete pic (with tdel).

  - Authentication: Apache. I.e., authenticated if REMOTE_USER is set.

    - You can set up whatever authentication and/or encryption (e.g. SSL)
      you want

Example setup with Apache::

    <Directory /home/quarl/proj/quickypix>
        Options ExecCGI
        Order allow,deny
        Allow from all
    </Directory>

    ScriptAlias / /home/quarl/proj/quickypix/src/quickypix/quickypix.py/
