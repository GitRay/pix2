general
-------

- better error reporting, e.g. explain to stderr when can't write to cache dir
  or log file

- packaging:
    - distutils setup.py
    - .deb

- send stderr of external programs through Exception, on error.  use backported subprocess.py.

- load config from /etc/quickypix

- importing from new ACDSee new XML format

- Hide albums with recursively no pictures

- Add next/previous links

Style stuff
-----------

- Highlight selected pic better

    - Make non-selected preview pics shaded lighter

- Fix pic vertical position (when scrolling)
    - "Position:fixed" only works in firefox -- use Javascript?

- Ajax stuff

    - URL: "album/#pic"

    - Javascript parses it and displays appropriate pic.

    - Should be compatible if with non Javascript.

    - Add "permalink"
